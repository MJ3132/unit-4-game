           <li>player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</li>
           <li>When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.</li>
           <li>Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.</li>
           <li>When they do click one, update the player's score counter.</li>
           <li>The player wins ifcb their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.</li>
           <li>The player loses if their score goes above the random number.</li>
           <li>The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.</li>
           <li>When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.</li>
           <li>The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.</li>
